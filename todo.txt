  check other districts use of indicators and if it's consistent with yard



inputs/outputs unused or uncertain of
 
    LATHAM:
		# outb[3] = setBit(outb[3], 5, self.rr.GetInput("P11").GetValue().GetStatus())   port(2)

    YARD:
		# outb[4] = setBit(outb[4], 2, self.rr.GetInput("P50").GetValue())  port

SHORE
 outb[3] = setBit(outb[3], 5, self.rr.GetInput("P32").GetValue())  port
# outb[2] = setBit(outb[2], 6, self.rr.GetOutput("P42.srel").GetStatus())	port





how to use release  yard and cliff
how to use control rabio buttons to limit control
call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc
how to use wos1norm in yard

do we really need a separate cliff fleet checkbox?  Na what is port fleeting if we have no control over port

check all block indicator outputs to see if I need a combined occupancy value like I do for block N25 in hyde

deduction of train movement - reporting train location
  checking train for non-contiguous Blocks

ATC
 need dcc interface

Auto routing

Simulator
  new commands for dispatcher in simulation mode:  placetrain, removetrain, set signal, get signal
